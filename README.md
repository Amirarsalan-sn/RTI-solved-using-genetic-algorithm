# RTI-solved-using-genetic-algorithm
solving Random 3-SAT(Boolean satisfiability problem) using Evolutionary algorithms like genetic algorithm.
This code provides a fast algorithm for evaluating a CNF. 
You can see how the cross-over, parent choice, survivors choice, and making children procedures are implemented.
You can use this code to design your own evolutionary algorithm.
